# ReceiptWallet

Description: Receipt Wallet is an application designed to help users manage receipts for household items such as electronics, furniture, and kitchen items. 
The app tracks the warranty expiration dates associated with these receipts and provides a comprehensive view of all receipts along with the number of days remaining until each warranty expires.
Users can edit the receipts, and each receipt also includes a product image that can be added by either taking a photo or uploading it from the gallery.
